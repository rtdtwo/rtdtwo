Hindi (Devanagari)  : ऋषभ तातिराजु

Telugu              : రిషబ్ తాతిరాజు

## How to pronounce my name?
`Rishabh` is my first name. It's a _Sanskrit_ name. `Rishab` is a widely used alternative, but I prefer the original.
- `Rish`, like `Rich` or `Rick` but with the `sh` (like in `shoe`) at the end.
- `abh`, `ab` (like in `abuse`). There's a partial `h` sound at the end (similar to `hundred`), but it is optional.

> The name means _the second note of music_, i.e _Re_ in _Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti_ (_Re_ is called _Re_ in Indian classical music too). It also means a _bull_, or _Taurus_, although _Rushabh_ is most commonly associated with that meaning.

`Tatiraju` is my last name.
- `Tati` sounds a lot like `Tatty`. Both the `T`s are pronounced with the tip of your tongue touching the space between the hard palate and the back of your upper incisor teeth. No word in English has a pronunciation this way, so I understand if you end up saying it `Tatty`.
- `Raju` sounds like the combination of `Ra` (like the Egyptian sun god) and `ju` (like in `juice`).

> Tatiraju is a rare [Telugu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_people) last name. People with this last name are almost certainly blood relatives. The current hypothesis about its origin is as an occupational surname introduced in medieval India when my ancestors,  were employed by kings as advisors and tax collectors.

## What's in a name?
A lot, actually - especially with Indian names having beautiful meanings turning into something opposite when non-Native speakers pronounce them _(see [Hardik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik))_. So, thank you for showing interest in pronouncing my name the correct way.

Most Indian names are from the [_Sanskrit_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit) language, a classical language with the first works dated around 1500 BCE. After being the primary language for official, literary, and religious purposes for more than 2500 years, _Sanskrit_ speakers slowly dwindled beginning in the 1500s, primarily due to the onset of European colonization. You can consider Sanskrit to be the _Latin_ of India.

_Sanskrit_ is a difficult language to master, even for Indians. There are no known native speakers today, but the language is culturally significant to date, with all sacred and literary works of Vedic India passed down to many generations using verbal or written _Sanskrit_. The legacy of _Sanskrit_ lives on in the form of its influence, either directly or indirectly, on the modern languages of India, including Hindi, Bengali, and Telugu, my native language.

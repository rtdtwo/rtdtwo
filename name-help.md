## What's in a name?
A lot, actually - especially with Indian names having beautiful meanings turning into something entirely opposite when non-Native speakers pronounce it _(see [Hardik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik))_. So, thank you for showing interest in pronouncing my name the correct way.

I get it, Indian names are hard to get right. Most Indian names are from the [_Sanskrit_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit) language, a classical language with the first works dated around 1500 BCE. After being the primary language for official, literary and religious purposes for more than 2500 years, _Sanskrit_ speakers slowly declined, primarily due to the onset of European colonization. 

_Sanskrit_ is a difficult language, even for Indians. There are no known native speakers of the language, but the language is culturally significant to date, with most sacred and literary work of Vedic India written in the language. It's legacy lives on in the form of its influence, either directly or indirectly, on the modern languages of India, including Hindi, Bengali and Telugu, my native language.

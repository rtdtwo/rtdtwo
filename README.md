Hi, I'm Rishabh! I'm currently a Computer Science grad student at the University of Florida, graduating May 2023. I code, sing, (pretend to) play the guitar, stargaze, annoy people with facts about anything and everything, and a bit more!

Currently hopping between 🎓 Gainesville, FL and 🗽 New York, NY. From Pune, MH, India 🇮🇳.

Hi, I'm Rishabh Tatiraju (_[pronunciation](https://github.com/rtdtwo/rtdtwo/blob/main/name-help.md)_). I'm currently a Financial Software Associate at Galatea Associates, LLC. I graduated from University of Florida with a Masters of Science in Computer Science degree in May 2023. I code mostly with Python, JavaScript and Java. I also work with system architecture sometimes. After work I like to sing and play the guitar, unwind the day with some classic rock on the turntable, stargaze, and a bit more!

Currently I'm hopping between Saint Petersburg, FL and  Jersey City, NJ. I have previously stayed for a significant amount of time in 🎓 Gainesville, FL and 🗽New York, NY. I'm originally from Pune, India 🇮🇳.
